    Minenials view travel as a birthright and I wanted to cater to their travel
    sensibilities with this branding project. Capsule hotels are gaining popularity in Japan,
    because they make travel more afforable - costing only $30-40 dollars per night in big cities like Tokyo.
    <br><br>
    As a money-conscieouss, adventurous millenial myself, I'd really love for this to come to every big city. I decided to create a potential brand for an American Capsule Hotel.
    Roost is of course playing on the fact that the cubbies are small and cute, but that the user has places to fly off to and just needs a place to lay their head.
