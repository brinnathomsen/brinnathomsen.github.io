      While participating in the Startup Studio course at Cornell Tech, I joined forces
      with a team of engineers and MBAs to create <b>Switch</b>, a digital insurance broker that offers <b>on-demand
      work benefits to freelancers</b>. I designed the UI/UX of the app,
      crafted the narrative of our pitch decks and developed the
      barebones of our brand.
      <br><br>
      Our idea helped us land the grand prize at the MIT FinTech Hackthon, a pitch to Mike Bloomberg
      and 100K in bridge funds at the Cornell Tech Startup Awards.

      When freelance work doesn’t provide benefits, getting insured can be <b>confusing</b> and <b>expensive</b>.
      By syncing with the marketplaces that freelancers work on, Switch analyzes things like their location and work
      hours in order to recommend <b>on-demand policies</b> that cover them for exactly what they need, no more — no less.
      When they’re completing a job, they’re covered.  When they aren’t, they’re saving money.
      <br><br>
      Switch also uses their marketplace information to offer them <b>discounted group
      policy rates</b>, which they can’t get on their own. With data and scale, Switch
      is working to make benefits easier and cheaper for freelancers to manage,
      so they can spend less time covering their losses and more time earning money.

    <div class="project-blurb">
      When signing up for Switch, the freelancer simply signs into their marketplace platforms.
      Switch then uses marketplace APIs to give them personalized policies based on their needs.
      <br><br>
      After the freelancer gets their <b>personalized insurance recommendations</b>,
      they can learn exactly what it covers in colloquial language.
      If they choose to purchase a policy, they can file claims, manage their coverage or
      add other insurance policies from the home page.
      <br><br>
      I used a <b>clean, clear design language</b> to make a complicated topic - like insurance - easier to
      grasp during demos.
