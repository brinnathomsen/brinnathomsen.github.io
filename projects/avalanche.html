    As part of a daily sketching practice in his class Computational Form, professor
    Justin Bakse requires his students
    to share their sketches online.
    Unsatisfied by off-the-shelf blogs, Justin and I built <b>Avalanche</b>, a
    collaborative site for students to post their sketches and provide each other feedback.


     <br><br>
      <b>Check it out >> </b> <a class="link" href="http://sketches.compform.net/" target="_blank">compform.net</a>


    <br><br>
    During Fall 2016, we designed and built the website and during Spring 2017, we user
    tested it with Justin's class.

      Sharing unfinished creative work can be tough. The design focused on
      encouraging students to post frequently and feel comfortable posting
      unfinished sketches and ideas while still fostering a competitive atmosphere.
      <br><br>

      Shame is a powerful tool. In order to motivate students to post regularly we
      created a <b>status bar</b> that greeted students each time they visited the site
      that publicly displayed their post status that week.
      <br><br>
      Slacking and procrastination was on display and that motivated students to post regularly.

        In an age where the amount of likes received on a social media post is tied
        to students self esteem, we wanted to limit discouragement. Ultimately we
        decided to use <b>emojis as interactions</b> because they are somewhat vague
        allowing students to say different things about a sketch other than ‘I like this’.
        We included the heart eyes emoji, the nerd glasses emoji and the laugh crying emoji.
        <br><br>
        We also allowed students to include inspiration links in their posts to help guide
        other students and provide useful resources.
